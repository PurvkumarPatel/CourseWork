Can the same be done with States of the United States?\n","When will it be available to general 365 users?\n","Love that you can now insert pictures into cells but I&#39;d love it even more if it would be possible to dynamically get them from the web via a link referenced somewhere else in the file. This would open up so many possiblities for me.\n","Awesome 👏. I have a question. Can I create a flow using power automate to check my emails for data requests sent to teams, extract, and list them in an excel sheet. The idea is to create a tracker sheet to track requests, dates requested and received. Is that possible or it’s a wild idea?

I&#39;m writing because I,&#39;ve noticed that lately my pivot tables won&#39;t give a row total but it will give me a column total.

Linking data via SharePoint gives enough trouble. But pivoting tables and images across multiple data sources and servers (SharePoint, which which are accessibly to everyone within the target audience)  always gives an error message like: &quot;This is not possible&quot;.

If I don&#39;t understand it right away to reverse it with undo, what options do I have?\n","Very nice video 📹 with bramd new informstion\n","i like power query  but i feel the more data you have the quicker it would be to do it with formulas and creating everything yourself. especially with data sets that continually increase such as if you&#39;re tracking multiple KPI&#39;s for each month and adding all the data to an annual folder. I don&#39;t know if that can be helped though.\n","I lav ya\n","your example is so cluttered and keeps me from wanting to implement this.\n","Thank you so much! I&#39;m going to use this right away; great tutorial. However, I&#39;ve noticed that when I add the flag field to pivot table, it displays &quot;image of country name...&quot; instead of the actual country flag image. Did I overlook a setting or option?
